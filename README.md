# Sound-control
This program uses OpenCV to control the sound of your device.
Start Sound control using finger.ipynb to run this program. Still, before that, make sure Some libraries like CV and mediapipe are installed. You also need to ensure which version of mediapipe is installed in your workstation as it can give an error. I am using 0.8.10, which is working fine.
This program uses the index finger as a switch to trigger its functioning and prevent unwanted sound changes.
You must manually check your device's sound and calibrate it as it changes from device to device.
